## Assignment 3

Working with your group partner, select a topic that you want to research using Twitter.

### What to submit

You are required to prepare

1. Prepare a presentation for a marketing company to give them insights about the prospective marketing compaign that they plan around your topic 
(as a video presentation supported by slides) 

2. A business report showing your insights and analysis in the form of a .rmd document

### What to do:

You will need to complete data collection using `rtweet` package, explore the data using `tidyverse` and `tidytext` package, 
do sentiment analysis of the collected tweets and build a prediction model.

Your prediction model may focus on predicting the popularity of the tweet (e.g. the number of likes/retweets) or the use characteristics (e.g. gender of a user)

For every step you need prepare visualizations that provide you with additional insights.

- data mining (=data collection)

- data exploration (e.g user data analysis, analysis of tweets, wordclouds, etc.)

- sentiment analysis of tweets

- prediction model and its evaluation


### Data:
You need to agree with partner on the topic you want to research. The topic should have enough tweets as well as "attract" likes/retweets

You will need to collect the data from Twitter using `rtweet` package - as shown during the tutorials. 

Because `rtweet` allows to collect data only over a limited timeframe, 
you will need to run your data collection script at least on a weekly basis (at least 3 weeks of data are required).

You will need to save your files from each script run under its own file name, then merge your files and remove duplicate entries. This was shown in the class
